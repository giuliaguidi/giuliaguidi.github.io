I'm an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cis.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University.
I received my PhD in Computer Science from UC Berkeley. I work in the field of high-performance computing (HPC) for large-scale computational sciences and lead the Cornell HPC group. I'm interested in developing algorithms and software infrastructures on parallel machines to speed up data processing without sacrificing programming productivity, and to make high-performance computing more accessible. I'm a big fan of sparse linear algebra and believe in sparse linear algebra as a computational abstraction for tackling large-scale computational challenges.

I received the [2024 SIAG/Supercomputing Early Career Prize](https://www.siam.org/prizes-recognition/activity-group-prizes/detail/siag-sc-early-career-prize), the [2023 ISSNAF Young Investigator Mario Gerla Award](https://cis.cornell.edu/guidi-wins-issnaf-young-investigator-mario-gerla-award), and the [2020 SIGHPC Computational & Data Science Fellowship](https://www.sighpc.org/for-your-career/fellowships/2020-fellowship-winners?fbclid=IwAR2N8swtCYgNH3phRmrFtASSC42b4oN5joG1l5XHFSdnkMY6U4HvZt3olLE). 

I'm an Affiliate Faculty in the Applied Math and Computational Sciences Division (Performance and Algorithms Group) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and a Graduate Field Faculty in the [Department of Computational Biology](https://gradschool.cornell.edu/academics/fields-of-study/field/computational-biology/) and the [Center for Applied Math](https://www.cam.cornell.edu/cam) at Cornell.

Publications, Talks, Teaching
------
For a complete list of publications, talks, and teaching information, please see my **[CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DmJgPIFg6S-B0bqvqWFUmrmk6czYVmy5/view?usp=sharing)** (I'm fairly good at keeping it up to date) or my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UZLC4TYAAAAJ) account. The PDFs of most of my articles can be found on arXiv. 

If you're interested in course or research talk slides, please feel free to email me. I'll add them here eventually.

<!-- Cornell HPC Group

I'm the proud PhD (co-)advisor of:

* [Julian Bellavita](https://jb2695.wixsite.com/jbellavita) (2023 --)
* [Ben Landrum](http://ben-landrum.com/) with [Professor Alex Conway](https://ajhconway.com/) (2024 --)
* [Irene Simó Muñoz](https://isimo00.github.io/) (2025 --)

Current MEng students:

* Andrew Chang
* Nakul Iyer
* Matthew Rubino

Current undergraduate students:

* Noam Benson-Tilsen (PhD student at Yale starting Fall 2025)
* Thomas McFarland
* Aaron Li
* Nolan Lizmi
* Zander Scharzberg

For a complete list of current and past students, please see my **[CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DmJgPIFg6S-B0bqvqWFUmrmk6czYVmy5/view?usp=sharing)**. I'll likely hire one PhD student with background in parallel programming and interest in high-performance computing for computational sciences next year (to start Fall 2026). The admissions process is through [Cornell CIS](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/phd/admissions) and not through me personally.

Useful Resources for Students
------

The list is under construction but in the meantime:

* [A doc with advice related to graduate school application](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1et1FK4_GlAZrxd7JoPzfqcLAZh_9sOm7HMov_hDGo98/preview?pli=1) (I wrote this as a graduate student at UCB, but it generally applies to any research university).
* [A repository with advice related to graduate school application, research, and PhD related to (mostly) CS, NLP, and ML](https://github.com/shaily99/advice).
* [A curated list of application resources for prospective graduate students in Computer Science](https://github.com/chinasaokolo/csGraduateApps).
* [Non-Technical Talks by David Patterson, UC Berkeley](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pattrsn/talks/nontech.html).
* [How to Give a Good Colloquium by John E. McCarthy, Washington University in St. Louis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AQJXRWYYY4o6AnBGB26NXccOdgnbMdQw/view?usp=sharing).
